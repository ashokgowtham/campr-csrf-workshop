# Campr Injection Workshop

## Getting started

Recommended: Use Intellij to open and import the application’s build.gradle file. This will sync your gradle system to the IDE.
If you don’t use Intellij, you can sync the gradle system according to your tool.

Run the application

```bash
./gradlew clean bootRun
```

Run the tests in debug to see the failing security test.

```bash
./gradlew clean test --debug
```

## Requirements

* JDK 1.7+
* A Java IDE

## Resources
